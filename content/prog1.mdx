---

During this course on Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), I deepened my understanding of core OOP principles, including concepts like classes, objects, and encapsulation. I gained hands-on experience in designing modular architectures, emphasizing key design practices such as coupling and cohesion, which are essential for building maintainable software systems. 

By working with arrays, lists, and collections, I learned how to effectively manipulate and store data, leveraging functional programming paradigms, including lambda expressions and streams. The course also introduced practical debugging and unit testing, sharpening my ability to ensure code quality and robustness through exception handling.

Moreover, I became proficient in using an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) to create, test, and debug software, while mastering version control to manage code changes effectively. With exposure to modelling tools like UML diagrams, I can now represent software design visually and apply these models to solve real-world programming challenges. The focus on interactive learning methods, including live coding sessions and individual mentoring, has equipped me with the skills to develop structured and well-documented code while critically using AI-based tools for software development.

Ultimately, this course has fortified my understanding of the complete software development lifecycle, from design to deployment, and instilled a solid foundation in OOP that I can apply across various projects and scenarios.
