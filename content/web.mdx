In this course on databases, I gained a strong foundation in data modeling, with a particular emphasis on conceptual modeling and relational databases. I learned how to design efficient database schemas using normalization theory and how to develop, test, and optimize database applications. Through hands-on projects, I worked extensively with SQL and relational algebra, gaining the skills to create and manipulate relational databases effectively.

I also explored key database management system (DBMS) features, such as query processing, transaction management, concurrency, and data integrity. The course provided practical insights into storage technologies, file organization, and index structures, helping me understand how databases manage data efficiently under the hood. Additionally, I learned about security measures essential to protecting data and applications within database systems.

Through peer code reviews and project work, I honed my ability to analyze and improve database performance while ensuring robustness against errors. This course equipped me with the skills to design functional, secure, and high-performing databases, preparing me to address complex data management challenges in real-world applications.

In this course on modern web technologies, I gained practical experience in developing full-stack web applications, from front-end design to back-end functionality. I learned how to work with essential web technologies, including HTML for markup, JavaScript for scripting, and HTTP protocols for network communication. Additionally, I explored server-side programming using Node.js, gaining a deeper understanding of how web servers and databases integrate to deliver dynamic, data-driven applications.

The course provided a solid foundation in the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture, allowing me to design structured, maintainable, and scalable web applications. I also worked with various web frameworks and libraries, which enhanced my ability to develop complex, interactive applications efficiently. A key focus was on ensuring the security and sustainability of web applications, teaching me how to create robust, maintainable solutions.

By working on collaborative projects, I developed skills in evaluating different technologies and reflecting on the approaches used in solving web development tasks. This hands-on experience gave me an industry-ready perspective on web application development, preparing me to create secure, efficient, and user-friendly digital services in a fast-evolving field.
