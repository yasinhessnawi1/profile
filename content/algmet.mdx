In this course, I developed a strong foundation in data structures and algorithms, learning how to implement and optimize structures such as arrays, queues, stacks, trees, and graphs. I gained the ability to analyze complex problems and apply the appropriate algorithms, including advanced searching, sorting, and graph traversal techniques. A key focus was understanding algorithm efficiency, both in terms of time and memory usage, which helped me grasp the importance of computational complexity.

I also honed my skills in recursion, applying this method to solve intricate problems effectively. The course emphasized abstraction in programming, teaching me how to structure reliable and efficient code to handle sophisticated challenges. By working with advanced data structures—particularly trees and graphs—I learned how to manage and manipulate complex datasets.

These skills allowed me to write fast and dependable programs while gaining the competence to analyze and solve non-trivial algorithmic problems. This course has significantly sharpened my problem-solving abilities and prepared me to handle both theoretical and practical aspects of computer science, with a focus on data structure management and algorithm design.
