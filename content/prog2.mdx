summary: "My second programming course with more advanced Java and JavaFx. (Programming 2 -IDATG 2001)"
---

In this course, I expanded my knowledge of object-oriented programming by diving into more advanced concepts such as inheritance and polymorphism, which allow for creating flexible and scalable software solutions. By exploring collaboration between objects and working with lists, sorting, and searching methods, I sharpened my ability to create efficient, reusable code.

The course introduced the development of graphical user interfaces (GUI) and data serialization, providing me with practical tools for building user-friendly applications and ensuring persistent data storage. Additionally, learning about exception handling and functional programming helped me refine my problem-solving skills by using higher-order functions and lambda expressions.

I also explored design patterns, which are essential for building robust and maintainable systems, and worked extensively with integrated development environments (IDEs) to debug, test, and manage version control effectively. Learning about databases and Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) added a new layer of understanding in handling data persistence and connecting object-oriented systems with relational databases.

Through practical assignments and projects, I developed programs that demonstrated delegation, task-sharing between objects, and the use of inheritance and polymorphism, along with ORM for database solutions. The course also highlighted the ethical considerations of unit testing and version control, encouraging a reflective approach to software development. This learning experience has significantly deepened my understanding of OOP, functional programming, and database integration, equipping me with the skills to handle real-world programming challenges effectively.
