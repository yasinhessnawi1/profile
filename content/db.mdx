In this course on databases, I gained a strong foundation in data modeling, with a particular emphasis on conceptual modeling and relational databases. I learned how to design efficient database schemas using normalization theory and how to develop, test, and optimize database applications. Through hands-on projects, I worked extensively with SQL and relational algebra, gaining the skills to create and manipulate relational databases effectively.

I also explored key database management system (DBMS) features, such as query processing, transaction management, concurrency, and data integrity. The course provided practical insights into storage technologies, file organization, and index structures, helping me understand how databases manage data efficiently under the hood. Additionally, I learned about security measures essential to protecting data and applications within database systems.

Through peer code reviews and project work, I honed my ability to analyze and improve database performance while ensuring robustness against errors. This course equipped me with the skills to design functional, secure, and high-performing databases, preparing me to address complex data management challenges in real-world applications.
