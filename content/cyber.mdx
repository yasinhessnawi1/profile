---

In this course, I developed a solid understanding of the fundamental concepts of cybersecurity and data networks. I became familiar with the TCP/IP model and network protocols, gaining insights into how data flows through modern networks and how network addressing works. This foundation was further strengthened by practical experience with command-line tools for communication and network security, where I learned to establish secure connections using cryptographic mechanisms.

A significant portion of the course was dedicated to identifying vulnerabilities in digital infrastructures and how to mitigate these risks through threat profiling and risk analysis. I also gained exposure to key cybersecurity terminology, historical developments, and organizational approaches to security. The legal and ethical implications of cybersecurity were explored, giving me a holistic view of the impact of digital threats on society.

In addition, the human aspects of cybersecurity, such as identity protection, authentication, and authorization, were examined, allowing me to better understand how to secure personal data. Through a blend of theoretical knowledge and practical exercises, I am now equipped to contribute to building and managing secure, resilient digital infrastructures, in line with global sustainability goals like SDG 8 (Decent Work and Economic Growth) and SDG 9 (Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure). This course has not only prepared me to handle technical challenges but also to address the societal implications of cybersecurity.
