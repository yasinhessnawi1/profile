Throughout my course in system development, I developed a comprehensive understanding of the entire software lifecycle, from analysis to deployment. We focused heavily on agile development methodologies, particularly Scrum, which gave me practical experience in managing iterative and incremental software projects. This experience was enhanced by learning continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipelines, which taught me how to streamline the development process and ensure the seamless delivery of software updates.

Additionally, the course provided an in-depth study of the Unified Modeling Language (UML), including essential diagrams such as use case, activity, class, and sequence diagrams. These tools enabled me to model complex systems, visualize workflows, and document software architecture. I became proficient in conducting vision and requirements analysis, which is crucial for designing solutions that align with client needs and goals.

I also explored key aspects of software architecture, risk analysis, and human-machine interaction, learning how to create user-friendly systems with universal design principles. Testing and user participation were major focus areas, where I applied different test strategies and user testing methods to ensure high-quality software development.

Through practical projects, I applied agile methods, developed UML models, and participated in every stage of the system development process. This allowed me to gain experience in project management, documentation, and delivering software solutions that meet both technical and ethical standards, including privacy regulations like GDPR. Working in teams and managing real-world challenges have equipped me with the skills to effectively collaborate and solve complex problems in professional environments.
