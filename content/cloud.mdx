In this course on cloud computing, I gained specialized knowledge of various cloud architectures and technologies, including Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), and Software as a Service (SaaS). I learned how cloud technologies manage processing, storage, and networking through virtualisation, and I explored the economic and business models that underpin cloud services, including pricing models and service-level agreements.

I also developed practical skills in designing and deploying cloud-based applications, using standard API frameworks such as REST, and integrating third-party APIs into solutions. The course covered essential cloud operations, including deployment and management of services, and it introduced me to the key service portfolios offered by major public cloud providers like Amazon, Google, and Microsoft.

Additionally, I gained an understanding of the legal, social, and ethical implications of cloud computing, alongside the technical challenges involved. The course allowed me to evaluate cloud vendors with a focus on security and economics, giving me a well-rounded view of cloud infrastructure and how it serves modern businesses. I also improved my programming abilities by learning to build and operate cloud services, ensuring I can create scalable and efficient cloud-based solutions.
