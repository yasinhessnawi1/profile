In my course on DevOps and Infrastructure as Code (IaC), I gained a solid understanding of how to manage infrastructure using code, applying the same principles used in software development. The course introduced me to foundational DevOps concepts, focusing on automation, version control, and continuous integration to streamline operations and development processes.

I gained hands-on experience with public cloud providers, learning how to provision, modify, and manage infrastructure resources in a code-driven manner. Using industry-standard tools, I implemented best practices for maintaining efficient and scalable infrastructures, ensuring that the infrastructure is not only reliable but also easily reproducible and maintainable. This involved writing code to automate repetitive operations, enhancing the efficiency of IT infrastructure management.

Additionally, I developed skills in deploying changes to production environments through version-controlled repositories and test environments, ensuring that infrastructure modifications could be safely introduced. The course emphasized the DevOps philosophy, teaching me how development and operations are integrated to create seamless, automated workflows, and giving me the insight to troubleshoot infrastructure issues using IaC. These skills have prepared me to effectively manage and optimize cloud infrastructures while adhering to the principles of automation and collaboration inherent in DevOps.
