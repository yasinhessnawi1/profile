In this course on modern web technologies, I gained practical experience in developing full-stack web applications, from front-end design to back-end functionality. I learned how to work with essential web technologies, including HTML for markup, JavaScript for scripting, and HTTP protocols for network communication. Additionally, I explored server-side programming using Node.js, gaining a deeper understanding of how web servers and databases integrate to deliver dynamic, data-driven applications.

The course provided a solid foundation in the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture, allowing me to design structured, maintainable, and scalable web applications. I also worked with various web frameworks and libraries, which enhanced my ability to develop complex, interactive applications efficiently. A key focus was on ensuring the security and sustainability of web applications, teaching me how to create robust, maintainable solutions.

By working on collaborative projects, I developed skills in evaluating different technologies and reflecting on the approaches used in solving web development tasks. This hands-on experience gave me an industry-ready perspective on web application development, preparing me to create secure, efficient, and user-friendly digital services in a fast-evolving field.
